# Demo : Segmentation of microscope image of glass surface for defects
---
Deep learning model for the detection of defects on the glass surface. Pytorch was mainly used in this project. This is a DEMO version for the origin project. 

# Project Background & Goal
---
For the cover glass of cameras on the back of mobile phone, laser cutting with chemical etching has been used as a new procssing technologh in the industry. However, after chemical etching, small pits can be observed on the etched glass surface. We found that the appearance of those pits could be related with the sub-surface damage on the glass surface before the chemical etching. To faciliate the evaluation process of those defects, such as number and size of those small pits, this machine learning model has been trained to automatically identify the defects and summarize the diameter of each defect.

# Technical Details
---
For a demonstration purpose, a simple U-net model has been used in this project. The project is based on pytorch.
